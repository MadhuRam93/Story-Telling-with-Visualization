# Story-Telling-with-Visualization
Visualizing IPL data as an example of story telling with data visualization

This is analysis of trends of different teams in IPL based on retention of players in 2013-14.
The data is assumed. Here, we can see several trends between teams - The proportion of players that were retained by a team in a 
given year, proportion of players who joined the team & the proportion of players who left or moved to other teams.

Chord diagrams are the best fit when you want to show directed relationships among a group of entities.
The chord diagram can easily show the amount of players retained and the player transfers between different teams.

Animation genre is chosen to implement the story telling narrative. 
1)	Information can be properly divided into subsets, where these subsets can be animated and shown on screen in a specific order.

2)	The use of chord diagram helped to easily represent teams on arcs. This allowed the data to be spread out radially,
adding to clean visuals.

3)	Animation is attention grabbing and can have a lasting effect on audience
